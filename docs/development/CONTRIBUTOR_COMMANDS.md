# Contributor Command and CI Contract

> **Owner**: RiskHub Maintainer

> **Audience**: Contributors, reviewers, CI maintainers
> **Change rule**: update this document, its machine contract, validator, and
> evidence together whenever command meaning or workflow topology changes.

RiskHub retains a broad internal automation surface for database, browser,
security, release, migration, and evidence workflows. Routine contributors use a
small stable façade:

```bash
./scripts/riskhub.sh <command>
```

The façade delegates to existing supported scripts and `scripts/Makefile`
targets. It does not reimplement their logic.

## Stable Commands

| Command | Canonical delegate | Meaning and side effects |
|---|---|---|
| `setup` | `./scripts/install.sh doctor --mode dev --repair` | Repairs dependency state, starts DB-only infrastructure, and starts daemonized backend/frontend services. It does not reset application data. |
| `dev [options]` | `./scripts/install.sh dev [options]` | Starts the supported local contributor workflow and forwards options such as `--backend`. |
| `lint` | `make -f scripts/Makefile lint lint-types` | Runs frontend lint/type/build/debt checks, backend Ruff and suppression checks, and backend mypy. |
| `test` | `make -f scripts/Makefile test` | Runs the default backend regression contract, excluding PostgreSQL-only and benchmark markers. |
| `e2e` | `make -f scripts/Makefile test-e2e` | Runs the guarded Playwright matrix and retains the explicit test-database safeguards. |
| `release-check` | `make -f scripts/Makefile release-parity-audit` | Runs the full local release-parity audit. It stops local development processes and tears down the active Compose stack before exercising runtime paths, so it may interrupt the current environment. It writes evidence under `tests/results/`. |
| `clean` | `make -f scripts/Makefile clean` | Tears down Compose volumes and removes Python/pytest caches, `node_modules`, frontend build output, coverage, and test results. It intentionally keeps `backend/venv`. |
| `help` | façade help | Prints this stable command set and the advanced-target discovery command. |

Environment variables pass through to the delegate. The façade does not bypass
safety guards, change exit codes, or supply alternate defaults.

## Advanced Surface

Specialized targets remain discoverable through:

```bash
make -f scripts/Makefile help
```

Use them for PostgreSQL-only tests, architecture locks, documentation topology,
security probes, deployment verification, migration rehearsals, release
publication, and benchmark lanes. Do not add a specialized target to the stable
façade unless it is a frequent end-to-end task with durable semantics.

## CI Gate Map

[`ci-gate-contract.json`](./ci-gate-contract.json) is the executable inventory.
It records exact workflow event filters, every governed job, protected-main
placement, owner, purpose, runtime budget, first-triage action, exact job
conditions, and blocking/advisory semantics. The validator compares these facts
to the actual YAML and rejects duplicate providers for protected check names;
generic event-name and substring checks are insufficient.

`release.yml` is additionally bound to the reviewed Git blob SHA recorded in the
machine contract. Any change to release publication, image builds, Linux bundle
verification, actions, jobs, or triggers changes that identity and requires an
explicit contract refresh after review.

Runtime ranges are maintained review budgets, not SLAs. Three consecutive
successful runs above an upper bound trigger owner review; product, security,
database, or release assurance must not be removed merely to meet the budget.

`Required` reflects the protected-`main` settings snapshot recorded during this
review. A required check must have exactly one pull-request provider that emits
that context for every applicable PR.

The full local `release-check` command is not equivalent to either hosted parity
job. It performs the comprehensive audit and has the disruptive local side
effects documented above.

## Change Policy

A change to this façade or CI map must:

1. remain a thin delegate to an existing canonical implementation;
2. preserve underlying environment variables, safety guards, and exit codes;
3. avoid a second implementation of test, install, or release logic;
4. update this document, `ci-gate-contract.json`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`, and
   `scripts/README.md` when their contract changes;
5. update the validator and focused tests;
6. reconcile exact workflow events, branch/tag filters, path filters, job names,
   exact job conditions, the release workflow Git blob SHA, and protected-branch
   settings;
7. describe command side effects and every CI job’s owner, purpose, runtime
   budget, execution lane, and first triage action.

bash -n scripts/riskhub.sh
