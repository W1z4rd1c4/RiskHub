# ADR-011 Auth Scheme and Session Model

## Status

Accepted

## Context

RiskHub authentication is implemented across `backend/app/api/v1/endpoints/auth/`, `backend/app/core/security.py`, and `backend/app/services/_auth_session/`. Protected endpoint authorization currently has three idioms in the codebase: the `require_permission(resource, action)` FastAPI dependency factory, body-call `_require_*` helpers, and inline `if not has_permission` branches that raise 403 responses.

The mock-auth fallback in `backend/app/core/security.py` is intentionally available for local demo and test flows only. It must remain gated by both `settings.mock_auth_enabled` and `settings.debug`.

ADR-002 records that the endpoint commit allowlist is empty. Microsoft Entra SSO enters through `backend/app/api/v1/endpoints/auth/sso.py`, while transport-neutral SSO challenge, identity, and session-lifetime decisions live under `backend/app/services/_auth_session/` and `_auth_session_workflow/`.

## Decision

JWT bearer access tokens, refresh-token rotation, and the user `token_version` field are the canonical authentication scheme. Refresh tokens are single-use per rotation; replay and logout paths revoke server-side refresh state and rely on token-version checks for access-token invalidation.

Production code imports authenticated-user dependencies from `app.api.deps`. `app.core.security.get_current_user` remains the lower-level implementation boundary and local mock-auth fallback, not the import target for protected endpoints. The mock-auth branch is valid only when `mock_auth_enabled and debug` are both true.

Endpoint authorization uses `require_permission(resource, action)` from `backend/app/core/security.py` as the canonical FastAPI adapter. ADR-001 keeps `Capabilities.can(action, resource, *, instance=None)` as the service-layer interface; this ADR elects `require_permission(resource, action)` as the endpoint adapter. Body-call `_require_*` helpers and inline `if not has_permission` 403 branches are frozen and must be non-increasing.

Microsoft Entra SSO is a deployment-time authentication option, not a separate RiskHub session model. Entra tokens are verified and resolved by `app.services._auth_session.resolve_sso_exchange`; `auth/sso.py` then issues the RiskHub access token through `_build_token_response` and the refresh row/cookies through `_issue_refresh_session`. New SSO providers must attach to the same exchange and refresh-rotation boundary instead of minting an alternate session.

Password, demo, SSO exchange, and refresh issue access tokens through `_build_token_response`. That shared boundary selects the configured lifetime with the canonical platform-administrator predicate and caps it at the remaining absolute SSO session lifetime. Managed production fixes ordinary users, including CRO, at 30 minutes and the platform-administrator role at 15 minutes.

Auth/session workflow commit adapters use `commit_auth_transaction`, and `commit_auth_transaction` delegates to `commit_service_boundary` with an `auth.` boundary prefix. New auth-flow entries in `_endpoint_commit_allowlist.toml` are forbidden unless this ADR and ADR-002 are superseded.

## Alternatives Rejected

- Cookie-session authority: rejected because it does not remove refresh rotation and complicates the existing API/frontend split.
- Three-idiom endpoint authorization as a permanent policy: rejected because mixed adapters make drift detection fragile.
- Removing local mock auth: rejected because supported demo and test flows depend on it; the debug-plus-mock guard is the production safety boundary.
- Letting Entra own RiskHub session lifetime: rejected because RiskHub permission revocation, token-version invalidation, refresh-row revocation, and audit behavior remain local responsibilities.

## Migration Impact

Finding `#76` migrated auth-flow endpoint commits to service-owned transactions. Existing `_require_*` body-call helpers and inline `has_permission` 403 branches remain during migration, but new occurrences fail the architecture ratchet.

SSO deployment configuration is unchanged. This ADR documents and locks the current exchange boundary: Entra identity verification resolves into a RiskHub session outcome, then RiskHub issues and rotates its own tokens.

Managed production renders and enforces ordinary users at 30 minutes and platform administrators at 15 minutes. Access tokens issued before rollout retain their signed `exp` claim, for up to the previous 60-minute lifetime, and age out naturally. The rollout requires no mass `token_version` bump or refresh-session revocation.

## Endpoint Commit Allowlist

The endpoint commit allowlist is empty. `tests/backend/pytest/architecture/test_w5_endpoint_commit_ratchet_red.py` fails on any endpoint `await db.commit()` that is not backed by a superseding ADR. Auth/session flows use `_auth_session_workflow` service adapters and the shared service transaction boundary instead of endpoint commits.

## Rollback Strategy

No schema rollback is required. Rolling back the managed-production lifetime policy requires reverting the runtime guard, renderer, preflight checks, and managed config together. Changing only the environment values back to 60 fails closed because the production runtime guard rejects them. If a future implementation regresses refresh rotation or token-version invalidation, operators can revoke affected server-side refresh rows and bump the affected users' `token_version` values.

## Invariant Tests

- `tests/backend/pytest/architecture/test_w5_endpoint_commit_ratchet_red.py` enforces the empty endpoint commit allowlist.
- `tests/backend/pytest/architecture/test_service_commit_boundary_ratchet_red.py` tracks remaining service-side raw commits as ADR-002 adoption work.
- `tests/backend/pytest/architecture/test_w12_auth_idiom_ratchet_red.py` keeps `_require_*` body calls and inline `has_permission` 403 branches non-increasing.
- `tests/backend/pytest/architecture/test_w12_get_current_user_isolation_red.py` forbids direct endpoint imports of `app.core.security.get_current_user`.
- `tests/backend/pytest/architecture/test_w12_mock_auth_guard_red.py` asserts mock auth is gated by both mock mode and debug mode.
- `tests/backend/pytest/architecture/test_w12_sso_token_exchange_boundary_red.py` locks the current SSO exchange boundary through `app.services._auth_session.resolve_sso_exchange`, `_build_token_response`, and `_issue_refresh_session`.
- The same architecture lock requires password, demo, SSO exchange, and refresh access-token issuance to converge on `_build_token_response` without directly calling `create_access_token`.

## ADR Cross-References

- ADR-001: keeps the service-layer capability interface separate from the FastAPI adapter elected here.
- ADR-002: governs service-owned transaction boundaries and the empty endpoint commit allowlist.
- ADR-003: keeps authentication and authorization failures mapped through the domain exception taxonomy.
- ADR-004: keeps token and refresh-session timestamps UTC-aware.
