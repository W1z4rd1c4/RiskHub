description: Create phases to close all gaps identified by milestone audit
---
<objective>
Create all phases necessary to close gaps identified by `/gsd:audit-milestone`.

Reads MILESTONE-AUDIT.md, groups gaps into logical phases, creates phase entries in ROADMAP.md, and offers to plan each phase.

One command creates all fix phases — no manual `/gsd:add-phase` per gap.
</objective>

<execution_context>
<!-- Executes planner process which has all planning expertise baked in -->
</execution_context>

<context>
**Audit results:**
Glob: .planning/v*-MILESTONE-AUDIT.md (use most recent)

**Original intent (for prioritization):**
@.planning/PROJECT.md
@.planning/REQUIREMENTS.md

**Current state:**
@.planning/ROADMAP.md
@.planning/STATE.md
</context>

<process>

## 1. Load Audit Results

```bash
# Find the most recent audit file
ls -t .planning/v*-MILESTONE-AUDIT.md 2>/dev/null | head -1
```

Parse YAML frontmatter to extract structured gaps:
- `gaps.requirements` — unsatisfied requirements
- `gaps.integration` — missing cross-phase connections
- `gaps.flows` — broken E2E flows

If no audit file exists or has no gaps, error:
```
No audit gaps found. Run `/gsd:audit-milestone` first.
```

## 2. Prioritize Gaps

Group gaps by priority from REQUIREMENTS.md:

| Priority | Action |
|

Create these {X} phases? (yes / adjust / defer all optional)
```

Wait for user confirmation.

## 6. Update ROADMAP.md

Add new phases to current milestone:

```markdown
### Phase {N}: {Name}
**Goal:** {derived from gaps being closed}
**Requirements:** {REQ-IDs being satisfied}
**Gap Closure:** Closes gaps from audit

### Phase {N+1}: {Name}
...
```

## 7. Create Phase Directories

```bash
mkdir -p ".planning/phases/{NN}-{name}"
```

## 8. Commit Roadmap Update

```bash
git add .planning/ROADMAP.md
git commit -m "docs(roadmap): add gap closure phases {N}-{M}"
```

## 9. Offer Next Steps

```markdown
## ✓ Gap Closure Phases Created

**Phases added:** {N} - {M}
**Gaps addressed:** {count} requirements, {count} integration, {count} flows



**Also available:**
- `/gsd:execute-phase {N}` — if plans already exist
- `cat .planning/ROADMAP.md` — see updated roadmap

---

**After all gap phases complete:**

`/gsd:audit-milestone` — re-audit to verify gaps closed
`/gsd:complete-milestone {version}` — archive when audit passes
```

</process>

## How Gaps Become Tasks

**Requirement gap → Tasks:**
```yaml
gap:
  id: DASH-01
  description: "User sees their data"
  reason: "Dashboard exists but doesn't fetch from API"
  missing:
    - "useEffect with fetch to /api/user/data"
    - "State for user data"
    - "Render user data in JSX"

becomes:

phase: "Wire Dashboard Data"
tasks:
  - name: "Add data fetching"
    files: [src/components/Dashboard.tsx]
    action: "Add useEffect that fetches /api/user/data on mount"

  - name: "Add state management"
    files: [src/components/Dashboard.tsx]
    action: "Add useState for userData, loading, error states"

  - name: "Render user data"
    files: [src/components/Dashboard.tsx]
    action: "Replace placeholder with userData.map rendering"
```

**Integration gap → Tasks:**
```yaml
gap:
  from_phase: 1
  to_phase: 3
  connection: "Auth token → API calls"
  reason: "Dashboard API calls don't include auth header"
  missing:
    - "Auth header in fetch calls"
    - "Token refresh on 401"

becomes:

phase: "Add Auth to Dashboard API Calls"
tasks:
  - name: "Add auth header to fetches"
    files: [src/components/Dashboard.tsx, src/lib/api.ts]
    action: "Include Authorization header with token in all API calls"

  - name: "Handle 401 responses"
    files: [src/lib/api.ts]
    action: "Add interceptor to refresh token or redirect to login on 401"
```

**Flow gap → Tasks:**
```yaml
gap:
  name: "User views dashboard after login"
  broken_at: "Dashboard data load"
  reason: "No fetch call"
  missing:
    - "Fetch user data on mount"
    - "Display loading state"
    - "Render user data"

becomes:

# Usually same phase as requirement/integration gap
# Flow gaps often overlap with other gap types
```
